# Precompiled Binaries

Source builds normally avoid these, so if you're planning on src-building the whole code from your own Windows machine, delete the files inside this directory if you already built it before and run `.\make.bat` from within the `$ROOT` of the project.

the idea of this subsystem is to run from a single .EXE binary, this normally being subsystem.exe

as a sidenote
`make.bat` cleans all the .obj files after compiling to avoid leftover files.
